# BGP-OSPF-EIGRP
The project demonstrates the structure and configuration of BGP in simulation environment.  We have designed complex network using EIGRP and OSPF routing protocols and redistributed the routes to BGP backbone network. Configuration of BGP on border routers does not guarantee the success of topology and the routes from different protocols should be redistribute from one protocol to other. We studied the route redistribution from OSPF to EIGRP, EIGRP to OSPF, OSPF to BGP, BGP to OSPF, EIGRP to BGP and BGP to EIGRP. First topology in the project demonstrate the failure of network due to misconfigured redistribution and the second topology successfully demonstrate the route redistribution scenario.
